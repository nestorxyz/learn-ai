The work you choose\nneeds to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a\nnatural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that\noffers scope to do great work.<br /><br />In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion.\nAmbitious people are if anything already too conservative about it.\nSo all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for\nand great interest in.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f1n\"><font color=#dddddd>1</font></a>]</font><br /><br />That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When\nyou're young you don't know what you're good at or what different\nkinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not\neven exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at\n14, most have to figure it out.<br /><br />The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not\nsure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going.\nYou'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's\ngood to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries\ncome from noticing connections between different fields.<br /><br />Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let \"work\"\nmean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do\ngreat work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own.\nIt may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your\npart of it.<br /><br />What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly\nambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves,\nexciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly\nambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach\nyourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered\nquestions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.<br /><br />There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the\nrudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let\nit have its way, will also show you what to work on.<br /><br />What are you excessively curious about &mdash; curious to a degree that\nwould bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.<br /><br />Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the\nnext step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the\nfrontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a\ndistance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get\nclose to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.<br /><br />The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because\nyour brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler\nmodel of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions\nabout things that everyone else took for granted. \n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f2n\"><font color=#dddddd>2</font></a>]</font><br /><br />If the answers seem strange, so much the better.

This is how practically everyone\nwho's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.<br /><br />Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible\nto prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the\nempirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality.\nThat's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply\ninterested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere\ndiligence ever could.<br /><br />The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the\ndesire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and\nthat combination is the most powerful of all.<br /><br />The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack\nin the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world\ninside.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring\nout what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't\ntell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which\nmeans the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for\nyears before you know how much you like it or how good you are at\nit. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning\nabout, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose\nlate based on very incomplete information.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f4n\"><font color=#dddddd>4</font></a>]</font><br /><br />The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in\ntwo forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that\ngrows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the\nmore you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what\nto do.<br /><br />The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They\nexpect you to commit to a field long before you could know what\nit's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal\ntrajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.<br /><br />It would be better if they at least admitted it &mdash; if they admitted\nthat the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what\nto work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow\nmagically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will:\nwhen it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own.\nSome people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will\nfind themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on\nthe assumption that everyone does.<br /><br />What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know\nwhat to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively,\nassuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action.\nBut there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read\nbiographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how\nmuch luck is involved.

Fields change as you\nlearn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very\ndifferent from what you do in high school math classes. So you need\nto give different types of work a chance to show you what they're\nlike. But a field should become <i>increasingly</i> interesting as you\nlearn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.<br /><br />Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than\nother people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the\nbetter. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste\nfor work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find\nnew things if you're looking where few have looked before.<br /><br />One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like\neven the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.<br /><br />But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the\ncourse of working on one thing you discover another that's more\nexciting, don't be afraid to switch.<br /><br />If you're making something for people, make sure it's something\nthey actually want. The best way to do this is to make something\nyou yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool\nyou want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests,\nthis will also get you your initial audience.<br /><br />This <i>should</i> follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most\nexciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason\nI mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong.\nInstead of making what they want, they try to make what some\nimaginary, more sophisticated audience wants.

At each stage do whatever seems most\ninteresting and gives you the best options for the future. I call\nthis approach \"staying upwind.\" This is how most people who've done\ngreat work seem to have done it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nEven when you've found something exciting to work on, working on\nit is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new\nidea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to\nwork. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't\nlike that.<br /><br />You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.\nThere are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a\ntechnique to working, just as there is to sailing.<br /><br />For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too\nhard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns:\nfatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health.\nThe point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the\ntype. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for\nfour or five hours a day.<br /><br />Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try\nto arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in.\nYou'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.<br /><br />It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working.\nYou'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial\nthreshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a\nflaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both\nper day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the\nsense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's\nok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over\nit.<br /><br />It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great\nwork, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm\nreluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by\nsaying \"I'll just read over what I've got so far.\" Five minutes\nlater I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and\nI'm off.<br /><br />Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie\nto yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example.\nLots of great things began with someone saying \"How hard could it\nbe?\"<br /><br />This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more\noptimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism\nis ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.<br /><br />Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be\nmore work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise\nin tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best\nwork happens in what was meant to be the final stage.<br /><br />Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what\nyou're working on, at least in your own mind.

Per-project\nprocrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting\nthat ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't\nquite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can\nget a lot not done.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f8n\"><font color=#dddddd>8</font></a>]</font><br /><br />One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it\nusually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around\ndoing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So\nper-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day\nprocrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.<br /><br />The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I\nworking on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok\nif the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous\nas you get older.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f9n\"><font color=#dddddd>9</font></a>]</font><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nGreat work usually entails spending what would seem to most people\nan unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of\nthis time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the\nwork sufficiently engaging as it's happening.<br /><br />There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years\nat things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not\nhow great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently\non something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take\nstock, you're surprised how far you've come.<br /><br />The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative\neffect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but\nif you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key:\nconsistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every\nday. They get something done, rather than nothing.<br /><br />If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most\npeople who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to\nthink about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon:\nthe more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.\nGrowing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more\nnew fans they'll bring you.<br /><br />The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat\nin the beginning.

How would you say what to\nbe, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're\nearnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar\nvices.<br /><br />The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're\ntaught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue &mdash; as a kind\nof sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new\nideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're\ntrying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can\nyou have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?<br /><br />One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight\npositive pressure in the opposite direction.

It's not merely the absence of something. It means\nfocusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.<br /><br />What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as\ndoing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing\nit. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being\ngood. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work:\nthey expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's\nbasically the definition of a nerd.<br /><br />Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need\nin doing great work.

So if you face a decision in the middle\nof working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.<br /><br />You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily\nhave to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some\neffort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias\nand laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat\nthis ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert\nto what I have now?<br /><br />Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit\njust because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of\neffort.<br /><br />Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're\ndoing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll\nunderstand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about\nwhether there's anything real there.<br /><br />Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from\nthe arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term \"elegant\"\napplied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior &mdash; \nthat the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical\nelegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.<br /><br />Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will\noften have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of\neffort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people,\nat least temporarily.<br /><br />Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively\nlittle effort, because it was in a sense already there.

Great ideas have to be\ntrue and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new\nideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers\nof knowledge.<br /><br />In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity,\nand imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name,\nbecause it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible\nto have a great deal of ability in other respects &mdash; to have a great\ndeal of what's often called \"technical ability\" &mdash; and yet not have\nmuch of this.<br /><br />I've never liked the term \"creative process.\" It seems misleading.\nOriginality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers\nthrow off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle\ngrinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.<br /><br />If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand\nvery well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most\noriginal thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got\ndivorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15\nyear old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see\noriginality separated from expertise like that made its nature all\nthe more clear.<br /><br />I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there\nare definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For\nexample, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're\nworking on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have\noriginal ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something\nslightly too difficult.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f15n\"><font color=#dddddd>15</font></a>]</font><br /><br />Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good\nway to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a\nmissing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you.\nIndeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.<br /><br />Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll\noften find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often\ndislodges them.

Curiosity feeds\noriginality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship\nis closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality;\nit's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since\nquestions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity\nat its best is a creative force.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nHaving new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of\nseeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a\nnew idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this\nbefore?<br /><br />When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably\na good one.<br /><br />Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having\nnew ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction?\nIt's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the\nway you look at the world. We see the world through models that\nboth help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas\nbecome obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.\nThat's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover:\nthey're easy to see after you do something hard.<br /><br />One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other\npeople. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where\nthey bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these\nclues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached\nto their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend\nto ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous\nit may seem in retrospect.<br /><br />To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead\nof looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the\nwild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was\nlooking for new ideas as because he was stricter.<br /><br />The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical\nas it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps\nto be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the\npoint of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially\nshares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.<br /><br />Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new\nideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem\nperfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world\nthey brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the\ngreater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally\naccepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.<br /><br />Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to\nmost people, or someone would have already explored it. So what\nyou're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of\ncrazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty.

But ideas that are the right kind of\ncrazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas\nideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.<br /><br />There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy\nbreaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases\nbeing aggressively and passively independent-minded.<br /><br />The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules\ndon't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional\nenergy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of\na project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it\nstarted.<br /><br />The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps\neven to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often\nmake new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts\nas a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies\nalso seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs.\nSeveral I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.<br /><br />Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination.\nIn popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken\nmodel in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial\nones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking <i>are</i>\nopposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers\ncan be truly strict.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nAn overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do\nsee it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious\nshoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much\nwork, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if\nyou could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.<br /><br />One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for <i>someone\nelse</i> to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to\nprotect you.<br /><br />You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other\ndirection: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished\nbut mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable\nideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.<br /><br />Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles.

They're not merely\nresponding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems\nare undervalued.<br /><br />One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the\nproblem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't.\nGreat work often takes something that already exists and shows its\nlatent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're\ninterested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let\ntheir skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.<br /><br />Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's\nno hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied\nelsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And\nthere's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that\nwould otherwise be wasted.<br /><br />But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly\nunfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't\nseem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these?\nBy being self-indulgent &mdash; by letting your curiosity have its way,\nand tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head\nthat says you should only be working on \"important\" problems.<br /><br />You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is\ntoo conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important\nbut overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already\non your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you\nwere going to take a break from \"serious\" work to work on something\njust because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The\nanswer is probably more important than it seems.<br /><br />Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than\noriginality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people\nwho discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the\ninitial step &mdash; deciding what to work on &mdash; is in a sense the key\nto the whole game.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nFew grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas\nis about the ratio of question to answer in their composition.\nPeople think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was\nin the question.<br /><br />Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used\nin schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being\nanswered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can\nbe much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery.\nHow do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to\nearth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By\neven asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel\nterritory.<br /><br />Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around\nwith you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of\nnoticing a solution &mdash; or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing\nthat two unanswered questions are the same.<br /><br />Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often\ncomes from returning to a question you first noticed years before\n&mdash; in your childhood, even &mdash; and couldn't stop thinking about.\nPeople talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful\ndreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful\nquestions alive.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f19n\"><font color=#dddddd>19</font></a>]</font><br /><br />This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from\nthe popular picture of it.

Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled\nabout something. Which means that originality consists partly of\npuzzlement &mdash; of confusion!

And this is\none of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best\nway to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones.\nQuestions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nThe best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread\nprotruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it\njust gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be\nobviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict\nthat. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to\npredict how much will unravel if you pull on it.<br /><br />It's better to be promiscuously curious &mdash; to pull a little bit on\na lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The\ninitial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side\nprojects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start\nlots of small things.<br /><br />Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try,\nthe greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand,\nthough, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things\nthat don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also\nhaving a lot of bad ones.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f21n\"><font color=#dddddd>21</font></a>]</font><br /><br />Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything\nthat's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by\ntrying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you\ndo look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when\nstarting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like\ntwo puzzle pieces.<br /><br />How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By\nmaking successive versions. Great things are almost always made in\nsuccessive versions.

And planning does\nusually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized\nto say \"we're going to do x and then y and then z\" than \"we're going\nto try x and see what happens.\" And it is more <i>organized</i>; it just\ndoesn't work as well.<br /><br />Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a\nnecessary evil &mdash; a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something\nyou have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or\nbecause you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If\nyou keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to\nplan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nTake as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk\nis proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a\nbet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally,\nyou're probably being too conservative.<br /><br />Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the\nyoung who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear\nrisk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.<br /><br />Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working\non it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and\nencountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably\nno better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying\nto do something slightly too hard.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nUse the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages\nof age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy,\ntime, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge,\nefficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of\nthe latter when young and keep some of the former when old.<br /><br />The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they\nhave. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest\nis probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time.\nThe best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly\nfrivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know\nabout, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just\nbecause it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.<br /><br />That \"slightly\" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly\nwhen you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference\nbetween doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing\nsomething you know for sure will be.

When your brain\nembraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit\ntogether perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but\noccasionally it's with the idea.

You'll be tempted\nto ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you.\nAnd you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep\nprogressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further\ninto the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If\nthey're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they\nprobably represent an undiscovered idea.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nOne of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience\nis to know what you <i>don't</i> have to worry about. The young know all\nthe things that could matter, but not their relative importance.\nSo they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much\nmore about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.<br /><br />But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience.\nThe other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at\nadulthood with your head full of nonsense &mdash; bad habits you've\nacquired and false things you've been taught &mdash; and you won't be\nable to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in\nthe way of whatever type of work you want to do.<br /><br />Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools.\nWe're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school\nas identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of\nstrange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.<br /><br />For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child,\nthere was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you\nwhat you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither\nclasses nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts\nof the way schools are usually designed.<br /><br />The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still\nin school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your\nteachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem\na stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's\nthe truth, economically, and in the best case it's the truth\nintellectually as well.

There's nothing\ninherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how\nsomething works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does\ncopying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the\npresence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.<br /><br />There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy\nsomething, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still,\nunconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed\nphrase \"Great artists steal.\" The really dangerous kind of copying,\nthe kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done\nwithout realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train\nrunning on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other\nextreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f25n\"><font color=#dddddd>25</font></a>]</font><br /><br />In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be\nin some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a\nvacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're\nfirst starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're\ngoing to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once\nyou're established, you can react to your own. But while the former\ngets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two\ncases are more similar than they seem.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes\nmakes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New\ndiscoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of\nexisting things, <i>even by their discoverers</i>, because there isn't\nyet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.<br /><br />There are definitely some dangers to copying, though.

History is so full of chance discoveries\nof this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by\ndeliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas\nfrom quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.<br /><br />Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones.

Most people who are very good at something are happy\nto talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're\nreally good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's\ninterest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their\nhobbies.<br /><br />It may take some effort to find the people who are really good,\nthough. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places,\nparticularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone\nis engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities\ncan't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in\ndifferent departments varies immensely. Some departments have people\ndoing great work; others have in the past; others never have.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nSeek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't\nbe done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's\ngood to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.<br /><br />Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect\nyou. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.<br /><br />Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better\nto have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good\nones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from\nhistory: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests\nthat one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great\nwork and not.<br /><br />How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues?

It's the basis of everything when you're working\non ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a\nliving organism.<br /><br />Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great\nwork if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of\nyourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.<br /><br />Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If\nyou choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a\nrefuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism,\nit's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by\nsome of the greatest minds in history.<br /><br />Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which\nincreases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this\ncycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing\ngood work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since\nit matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right\ndirection, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when\nyou're stuck, just so you start to get something done.<br /><br />One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow\nsetbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a balloon bursting.\nYou can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering\nsetbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always\ninvolves some backtracking.<br /><br />Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the\ndesire to. So \"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again\" isn't\nquite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either\ntry again, or backtrack and then try again.<br /><br />\"Never give up\" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times\nwhen it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would\nbe: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you\nneed to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.<br /><br />It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more\nthan it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends\nhow fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from\nbad.

If you're\nambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition;\nso someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you,\nor does and doesn't care.<br /><br />Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's\nimportant to take care of it. That means exercising regularly,\neating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of\ndrugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise\nbecause they're good for thinking.\n<font color=#dddddd>[<a href=\"#f29n\"><font color=#dddddd>29</font></a>]</font><br /><br />People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone\nelse, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't.

If you made it\nthis far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so\nyou're already further along than you might realize, because the\nset of people willing to want to is small.<br /><br />The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal,\nmathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and\nluck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can\nignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to\ndo great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest.\nCan you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will\ncombine to yield an explosion of new ideas?<br /><br />Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different\nways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered.\nOut of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited\nfor is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close\nmatch. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your\nability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by\ntrying.<br /><br />Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds\nthem back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous\nto try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if\nyou tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation\nis rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do\ngreat work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy\naway from the question.<br /><br />So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great\nwork, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that.\nI wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know\nyou're interested.<br /><br />Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone.\nAnd if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have\nworse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst\nproblem you have.<br /><br />Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to\nwork hard. And if you're working on something you find very\ninteresting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path,\nthe work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your\npeers'.<br /><br />The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made.
